# Java Training

`Java` was my first love as a programming language, starting back in 2001 in my first professional programming job. So when I got back into coding after a 10 year hiatus, it was one of the first things I tried to reconnect with.

Unlike the other `Training` repos I have setup, this one has been primarily used as a space to work on various challenges, included those from `HackerRank` and from interviews at `Amazon`. I've attempted to use some of the newer paradigms such as streams and reducers but have mostly stuck to my old school knowledge.
